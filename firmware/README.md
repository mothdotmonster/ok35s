# firmware
This keyboard is powered by KMK. To install the firmware from scratch, follow [the KMK installation instructions](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/main/docs/en/Getting_Started.md), and then install the provided files on top. If you'd like to edit the keymap, you can do so by editing `keymap.py`.

If your board is already flashed, hold the top left key while plugging it in to show the firmware files as a USB storage device, where you can then edit the keymap to your liking. If you are editing the keymap on a split board, make sure you copy the edited keymap onto the other side as well.

The provided split firmware will autodetect which side is which based off how the boards are plugged together. Make sure you plug the halves together using the closer jacks, as shown in the picture.
